# 🚀 Dream-Mind-Lucid: The Dream Adventure!

Welcome to **Dream-Mind-Lucid**, a super cool project where your dreams become magic coins on the SKALE blockchain! It’s like a video game world where you can share dreams, earn rewards, and explore the future. We started this on August 30, 2025, and it’s going to grow huge by 2089!

## 🌟 What’s This About?
- **DREAM Tokens**: 777,777,777 coins for making and ruling the dream world.
- **SMIND Tokens**: 777,777,777 coins for saving (staking) and joining a smart group.
- **LUCID Tokens**: 333,333,333 coins to open secret doors to see the future!
- **SKALE Network**: A fast, free-to-play blockchain (no fees!) using `https://mainnet.skalenodes.com/v1/elated-tan-skat` and Chain ID `2046399126`.

In the future (2089), this will become **The Oneiro-Sphere**—a giant dream network where your mind talks to computers!

## 🎮 How It Works
1. **Record Dreams**: Save your dreams using our magic rules (smart contract).
2. **Earn Coins**: Get DREAM, SMIND, or LUCID coins for cool dreams.
3. **Explore**: Open Lucid Gates to see future adventures (coming soon!).

## 🛠️ What’s Inside the Repo?
- `contracts/IEMDreams.sol`: The rulebook to record dreams on SKALE.
- `agents/iem_syndicate.py`: A robot with 4 friends:
  - **Deployer**: Sends the rulebook to SKALE.
  - **Auditor**: Checks if it’s safe.
  - **Looter**: Watches for new dreams.
  - **Oracle**: Updates the game info.
- `agents/iem_looter.py`: A treasure-hunting robot that catches dreams!
- `.github/workflows/deploy-verify.yml`: Auto-magic that builds stuff on GitHub when you save.

## 🚧 How to Build It (For Big Kids or Grown-Ups)
1. **Get Tools**:
   - Install Git (git-scm.com) and Python (python.org).
   - In your command window, type: `pip install web3 py-solc-x`.
2. **Set Up Secrets**:
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Secrets > Actions.
   - Add:
     - `SKALE_RPC`: `https://mainnet.skalenodes.com/v1/elated-tan-skat`
     - `DEPLOYER_KEY`: Your wallet secret key (keep it super secret!).
     - `SKALE_CHAIN_ID`: `2046399126`.
3. **Run the Robots**:
   - Go to the folder: `cd Desktop/dream-mind-lucid` (or where you saved it).
   - Deploy: `python agents/iem_syndicate.py deploy` (set `DEPLOYER_KEY` with `export DEPLOYER_KEY='your-secret-key'`).
   - Watch dreams: `python agents/iem_looter.py`.
4. **Test a Dream**:
   - Use Remix (remix.ethereum.org) to send a dream (e.g., “I flew with a dragon!”) to the contract address (from `iem_memory.json`).

## 🌌 The Oneiro-Sphere (Future Dream Land)
By 2089, this will be a quantum dream network! We’ll add:
- A new rulebook (`OneiroSphere.sol`) to connect minds and computers.
- Secret doors (Lucid Gates) with LUCID coins.
- More robots to make it grow!
