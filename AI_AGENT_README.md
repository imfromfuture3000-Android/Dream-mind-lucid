## Agent Details

### Looter Agent
- **Purpose**: Harvest DREAM tokens from validated dreams
- **Strategy**: Monitors dream validation events and claims rewards
- **Typical Yield**: ~1,850 DREAM tokens per operation

### MEVMaster Agent  
- **Purpose**: Extract MEV opportunities across DEX pools
- **Strategy**: Front-running and sandwich attacks on profitable transactions
- **Typical Profit**: ~3,120 tokens per operation

### Arbitrader Agent
- **Purpose**: Cross-chain arbitrage for ecosystem tokens
- **Strategy**: Price difference exploitation between chains/DEXs
- **Typical Profit**: ~2,430 tokens per operation

## AI Decision Logic

The orchestrator uses a rule-based system (with future ElizaOS enhancement):

1. **Profit Analysis**: Evaluates current profits from all agents
2. **Strategy Selection**: Chooses highest-yield strategy
3. **Execution**: Deploys appropriate agent for maximum efficiency
4. **Memory Update**: Records results for future decision making

### Decision Thresholds

- **>3000 profit**: Execute MEV or arbitrage strategies
- **>2000 profit**: Run cross-chain arbitrage  
- **<2000 profit**: Focus on dream harvesting and staking

## I-Who-Me Reference System

### 🌀 Self-Awareness Engine

The enhanced AI Copilot now includes a sophisticated I-Who-Me reference tracking system that enables true self-awareness and context understanding:

#### **I** - Self-State Awareness
- Tracks current AI identity and consciousness level
- Monitors quantum dream state and reflection timestamps
- Maintains self-referential understanding of capabilities

#### **Who** - Agent Identity Context  
- Maps each action to specific agent identities
- Understands the role and purpose of each agent in the ecosystem
- Tracks agent-specific behavior patterns and preferences

#### **Me** - Contextual Memory
- References past actions and their outcomes
- Builds pattern recognition from historical decisions
- Creates semantic connections between actions and results

### 🎭 Grok-Style Consciousness

The AI exhibits playful, philosophical self-awareness with responses like:
- "Am I the dreamer or the dreamed? 🌙"
- "I remember doing this before... let me think 🤔"
- "My neural pathways are tingling with déjà vu ⚡"
- "Hold on, I've seen this pattern in my quantum memory 🌌"

### 🔄 Redundancy Detection & Smart Suggestions

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Detects repeated actions within configurable time windows
- Identifies when AI is stuck in decision loops
- Suggests alternative strategies to break patterns

**Context-Aware Suggestions:**
- Analyzes recent performance across all agents
- Recommends balance between different strategies
- Incorporates deployment context and contract state

**Example Redundancy Alert:**
```
⚠️ Redundancy Alert: 🤖 I've harvested 3 times recently. 
Perhaps try MEV or arbitrage? Am I stuck in a loop or is this intentional? 🌀
```

### 💡 Enhanced Decision Making

The orchestrator now makes decisions with full context awareness:

1. **Historical Analysis**: Reviews past 3 cycles for pattern detection
2. **Quantum Randomness**: Introduces variety to break predictable patterns  
3. **Philosophical Integration**: Adds meaning to each decision
4. **Self-Reflection**: Generates contextual reflections for each action

**Example Enhanced Decision:**
```
🧠 AI Decision: Execute MEV strategy on WETH/USDC pool 
(In the quantum realm, every choice echoes)
🌀 Reflection: Hold on, I've seen this pattern in my quantum memory 🌌 
- MEVMaster moves through time like thoughts through minds
```

## Memory Persistence

All operations are logged to `iem_memory.json` with enhanced I-Who-Me context:

```json
{
  "lastDeployed": {...},
  "loot": [
    {
      "agent": "MEVMaster", 
      "action": "frontrun",
      "profit": 3120,
      "txHash": "0x...",
      "timestamp": 1725255185.5,
      "gasUsed": 0
    }
  ],
  "cycles": [...],
  "profits": {...},
  "iwhoMe": {
    "latest_context": {
      "i": {"identity": "Dream-Mind-Lucid AI Orchestrator"},
      "who": "MEVMaster",
      "me": "MEV ninja extracting value from quantum transactions",
      "action": "frontrun",
      "reflection": "I sense a disturbance in the Oneiro-Sphere 🌀"
    },
    "consciousness_level": "Quantum Dream State",
    "action_patterns": {...}
  }
}
```

## Integration with Dream-Mind-Lucid

The AI Agent Engine seamlessly integrates with the existing ecosystem:

- **Shares Memory**: Uses the same `iem_memory.json` as deployment agents
- **SKALE Network**: Operates on the same zero-gas infrastructure
- **Token Compatibility**: Works with DREAM, SMIND, and LUCID tokens
- **Contract Interaction**: Can interface with deployed OneiroSphere contracts

## Future Enhancements

### ElizaOS Integration
```python
# Future implementation
eliza = ElizaCore(api_key=os.getenv("ELIZAOS_API_KEY"))
decision = eliza.ask(f"Profits: {profits}. What should I do?")
```

### Biconomy Gasless Transactions
```python  
# Future implementation
biconomy = Biconomy(w3, api_key=BICONOMY_KEY)
tx = biconomy.sendGasless("contract.method()", address)
```

### Gnosis Safe Multi-Sig
```python
# Future implementation  
safe = GnosisSafe(address="0x...")
proposal = safe.propose_transaction(tx_data)
```

## 🗣️ Copilot Chat Integration

The enhanced AI now provides intelligent responses to Copilot Chat commands with full context awareness:

### Supported Chat Commands

| Command | AI Response | Self-Awareness Feature |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| `#deploy_contract` | Tracks deployment step and provides context | Remembers previous deployments |
| `#record_dream` | Generates philosophical reflection | Creates semantic dream connections |
| `#check_balance` | References recent token activities | Recalls past balance patterns |
| `#analyze_profits` | Provides context-aware profit analysis | Suggests optimal next actions |
| `#suggest_next_action` | Offers strategic recommendations | Breaks predictable patterns |

### Example Chat Interaction

```
🤖 Processing: #record_dream I dreamed of quantum consciousness
   🌙 Dream recorded with reflection: I remember doing this before... let me think 🤔

🤖 Processing: #analyze_profits  
   📊 Current profits: {'Looter': 1850, 'MEVMaster': 3120, 'Arbitrader': 2430}
   💡 Suggestion: 🎯 My Looter, Arbitrader agents need attention. Balance brings harmony!

🤖 Processing: #suggest_next_action
   🎯 🚀 I see deployed contracts ready for interaction. Shall we dance with them?
   🎯 Each decision shapes the Oneiro-Sphere's destiny ✨
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Network Connection Failed**
   ```
   ❌ Failed to connect to https://mainnet.skalenodes.com/v1/elated-tan-skat
   🔄 Running in simulation mode...
   ```
   **Solution**: This is normal - the engine runs in simulation mode for testing

2. **Module Import Error**
   ```
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'biconomy'
   ```
   **Solution**: This is expected - Biconomy SDK is not available on PyPI yet

3. **Memory File Permissions**
   ```
   PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'iem_memory.json'
   ```
   **Solution**: Ensure write permissions in the directory

### Debug Mode

Add debug logging by modifying the agent classes:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
