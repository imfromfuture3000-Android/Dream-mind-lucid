Placeholder: Implement BLS threshold verification.

Options:
- Add on-chain BLS verifier contract (e.g., using bls12-381 pairing library compiled to EVM precompile).
- Use a verifier contract that accepts aggregated public key and signature and performs pairing checks.
- Alternatively, rely on SKALE precompiles or operator-signed notarization for production.
